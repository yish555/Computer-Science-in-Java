Solutions for questions 1 and 2 in a summarized form from 2016 to 2025A.

Some of the solutions I wrote, and some I collected during the semester, but they work and will receive the maximum points.

Feel free to add your code, if you can do better;)
Feel free to continue publishing the answers for the next semesters and for the next students in line.

(Do this in a file named "Learning")

THANKS.

GOOD LUCK &&  enjoy:)
